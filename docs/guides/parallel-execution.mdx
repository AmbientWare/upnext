UpNext provides utilities for running multiple tasks in parallel. These work with both `Future` objects and regular awaitables, and are the building blocks for [multi-step workflows](/concepts/workflows).

## `gather` — run all, wait for all

Submit multiple tasks and wait for all of them to complete:

```python
import upnext

user, orders, notifications = await upnext.gather(
    fetch_user.wait(user_id="123"),
    fetch_orders.wait(user_id="123"),
    fetch_notifications.wait(user_id="123"),
)
```

`gather` also works with Futures:

```python
future_a = await task_a.submit(x=1)
future_b = await task_b.submit(x=2)

results = await upnext.gather(future_a, future_b)
```

### Handle errors gracefully

By default, `gather` raises on the first error. Set `return_exceptions=True` to collect errors as results instead:

```python
results = await upnext.gather(
    task_a.wait(x=1),
    task_b.wait(x=2),
    task_c.wait(x=3),
    return_exceptions=True,
)

for result in results:
    if isinstance(result, Exception):
        print(f"Task failed: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Task succeeded: {result}")
```

## `map_tasks` — fan out with concurrency control

Apply a task to a list of inputs with bounded concurrency:

```python
results = await upnext.map_tasks(
    process_item,  # TaskHandle from @worker.task
    [{"item_id": i} for i in range(1000)],
    concurrency=10,
)
```

This submits up to 10 jobs at a time and waits for all of them to finish. Each dict in the input list is unpacked as keyword arguments to the task.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | `TaskHandle` | required | The task to execute |
| `inputs` | `list[dict]` | required | List of keyword argument dicts |
| `concurrency` | `int` | `10` | Maximum concurrent executions |

## `first_completed` — race multiple tasks

Return the first result and cancel the rest:

```python
result = await upnext.first_completed(
    fetch_from_provider_a.wait(query="data"),
    fetch_from_provider_b.wait(query="data"),
    fetch_from_provider_c.wait(query="data"),
)
```

Useful for racing multiple providers, fallback strategies, or timeout patterns.

```python
result = await upnext.first_completed(
    slow_task.wait(x=1),
    fast_task.wait(x=1),
    timeout=10.0,  # Overall timeout
)
```

## `submit_many` — fire and forget in bulk

Submit multiple jobs without waiting for results:

```python
futures = await upnext.submit_many(
    process_item,
    [{"item_id": i} for i in range(1000)],
)

# futures is a list of Future objects
# Collect results later when needed
for future in futures:
    result = await future.result()
```

Unlike `map_tasks`, `submit_many` returns immediately with a list of `Future` objects. Use it when you want to submit all jobs upfront and collect results later (or not at all).

## Workflows

All of these primitives work inside nested tasks. When a parent task uses `gather`, `map_tasks`, or `first_completed` to coordinate child tasks, UpNext automatically tracks the parent-child lineage through the entire execution tree.
