UpNext is a framework for running background workers, APIs, cron jobs, and event-driven tasks with a shared Redis-backed runtime. Define your work with simple decorators, monitor everything from a real-time dashboard.

## Two ways to run

UpNext works in two modes. Start with **SDK + Redis** to get the core runtime, then add the **server** when you want monitoring, persistent history, and management tools.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SDK + Redis">
    Everything you need to run workers and APIs. Just install the package and point at Redis.

    | Feature | |
    | --- | --- |
    | Background tasks | Retries, timeouts, progress tracking |
    | Workflows | Nested tasks with parent-child lineage and failure propagation |
    | Cron jobs | Recurring schedules with standard cron syntax |
    | Events | Pub/sub handlers with typed payloads |
    | HTTP APIs | Endpoints powered by FastAPI |
    | Parallel execution | `gather`, `map_tasks`, `first_completed` |
    | Error handling | Automatic retries, backoff, and durable failure history |

    ```bash
    pip install upnext
    UPNEXT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 upnext run service.py
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SDK + Redis + Server">
    Everything above, plus a dashboard and management layer. The server adds features that require persistent storage.

    | Feature | |
    | --- | --- |
    | Dashboard | Real-time web UI for jobs, workers, APIs, and metrics |
    | Job history | Persistent, queryable history of all executions |
    | Artifacts | Attach outputs (JSON, images, PDFs) to jobs and browse them |
    | Secrets | Encrypted key-value store injected as environment variables |
    | Authentication | API key auth with user and key management |
    | Admin tools | Create users, rotate keys, manage access |

    ```bash
    pip install upnext
    upnext server start --port 8080     # Start the server
    UPNEXT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 \
    UPNEXT_URL=http://localhost:8080 \   # Connect to the server
    upnext run service.py
    ```
