## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Redis 7+** — used as the queue backend
- **pip** or [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — for package management

## Install UpNext

The `upnext` package includes the SDK, runtime engine, CLI, and the dashboard server.

  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install upnext
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="uv">
    ```bash

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Start Redis

UpNext requires a running Redis instance. The easiest way to get one locally is with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

<Tip>
If you already have Redis running, just make sure it's version 7 or higher and accessible at `redis://localhost:6379`.
</Tip>

## Verify your installation

```bash
upnext --version
```

You should see the installed version printed. You're ready to build your first service.
