The UpNext dashboard provides real-time visibility into your entire runtime. Here's what each page shows.

## Dashboard (Home)

The main overview page displays:

- **Trend charts** — job throughput, success/failure rates over time
- **Queue stats** — current queue depth, processing rate
- **Top failing functions** — functions with the highest failure rates
- **Recent activity** — latest job completions and failures

## Jobs

The **Jobs** page shows a timeline view of all job executions:

- **Timeline visualization** — horizontal bars showing job duration and overlap
- **Nested task trees** — parent-child relationships displayed as expandable hierarchies
- **Job details** — click any job to see status, progress, attempts, errors, artifacts, and logs
- **Filters** — filter by status (running, complete, failed), function name, and time range

## Functions

Browse all registered task, cron, and event handler definitions:

- **Function list** — name, type (task/cron/event), configuration
- **Execution stats** — success rate, average duration, total runs
- **Configuration details** — retries, timeout, schedule (for crons)

## Workers

Live view of all connected worker instances:

- **Active workers** — name, status, concurrency settings
- **Task counts** — jobs in progress, completed, failed
- **Health status** — connectivity and heartbeat information

## APIs

Monitor your HTTP API instances:

- **Active APIs** — name, host, port, registered routes
- **Request metrics** — throughput, latency, error rates
- **Request tracking** — recent HTTP requests with status codes and durations

## Artifacts

Browse artifacts created by jobs:

- **Artifact list** — name, type, associated job, creation time
- **Inline previews** — JSON data rendered in a viewer, images displayed inline
- **Download** — retrieve artifact files directly

## Activity

A live event feed showing everything happening in your runtime:

- **Real-time updates** — job starts, completions, failures, and retries as they happen
- **Event stream** — powered by server-sent events for instant updates

## Secrets

Manage encrypted secrets:

- **Secret list** — names and last-updated timestamps (values are hidden)
- **Create/update/delete** — manage secrets directly from the UI

## Admin

Available when authentication is enabled:
