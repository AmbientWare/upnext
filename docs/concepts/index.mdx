UpNext has two main service types: **Workers** and **APIs**. Workers process jobs from a Redis-backed queue. APIs serve HTTP endpoints powered by FastAPI. You can run them independently or together.

Workers execute three kinds of jobs:

- **Tasks** — one-off background jobs, submitted programmatically or via the CLI
- **Events** — pub/sub handlers that trigger when an event is published
- **Crons** — recurring jobs on a schedule

**Core** features work with just the SDK and Redis. **Server** features require the UpNext server — see [Two ways to run](/get-started#two-ways-to-run).
